To make an ATC voice pack, you must copy this folder into your Mods folder.

Rename the folder!

Change the text inside "atcvoiceinfo.txt" to the name of your voice pack.

The text inside "atcvoiceinfo.txt" must be unique!

Add a multiple .wav file inside each of the sub folders,
the game will randomly pick sounds from these files,
except in cases where the sounds are for letters, number or directions
Where the name of the .wav file does matter, I have included instructions in more READ ME.txt files.
If you leave a folder empty, it should play the stock sound effect instead.
